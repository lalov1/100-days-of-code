# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the Twitch project in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Finished the CSS portion and moved on to the Javascript portion. Trying to do this lesson with just Vanilla JS, so it is taking me a little longer than expected because I relied on jQuery for so long.
