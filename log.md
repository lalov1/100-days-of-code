~~### Day 2: January 4, Wednesday~~

~~**Today's Progress**: Still working on the Twitch project in FreeCodeCamp.~~

~~**Thoughts** Finished the CSS portion and moved on to the Javascript portion. Trying to do this lesson with just Vanilla JS, so it is taking me a little longer than expected because I relied on jQuery for so long.~~
